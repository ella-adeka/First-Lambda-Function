# First Lambda Function

In this project, we will create an AWS Lambda function using Python (or your preferred programming language) that listens for S3 bucket events, specifically 'ObjectCreated' events. When a new object is uploaded to a specified S3 bucket, the Lambda function will be triggered automatically. The function will then perform a predefined task, such as resizing images, processing data, or sending notifications.
